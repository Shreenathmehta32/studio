## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FF7043) to evoke warmth and optimism, nodding to India's rich cultural associations with the color saffron, and contrasting with the background color. The goal is a contemporary style with local relevancy.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a very desaturated near-analog to orange. It establishes a calm and inviting base for the interface, creating a comfortable user experience, while adhering to a light color scheme to improve readability.
- Accent color: Teal (#4DB6AC) will highlight interactive elements, creating an element of dynamism that will guide the user toward their most important goals on the site. 
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a sans-serif font, for a contemporary, geometric feel. Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, for readability and warmth.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that are easily recognizable, with a consistent style throughout the platform. The icons should be related to mental health and well-being, reflecting cultural sensitivity.
- The layout should be modular and responsive, ensuring that the platform is accessible and functional on devices with varying screen sizes. Prioritize readability, with sufficient white space to avoid overcrowding.
- Employ subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide users through the interface, creating a smoother and more engaging experience.
